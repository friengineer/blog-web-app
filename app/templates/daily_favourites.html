    Here you’ll find a random collection of some of my favourite things, but don’t be fooled by the title they may not always be daily but will always be something I’m loving on that day; however, there will be a post at least every week and maybe more.

  <h2 id="5">Chanel: Coco Mademoiselle Eau De Parfum - 02/03/2018</h2>

  <p>
    I’m not a massive perfume person unlike many people my age but I do have a few and I must say that this Chanel fragrance has to be my fave. I know it’s expensive, I remember how undecisive I was when I went to buy it as I never spend that much money on something that isn’t technology, but it is worth every penny. I can’t describe the scent as it’s something I struggle with but if you happen to pass a chanel counter I recommend giving it a smell, you won’t be disappointed I promise; now I’m not telling you to go out and buy it as it is hella expensive and I worked a lot of hours to be able to get it, but just remember it’s okay to treat yourself sometimes.

  <p>
    This may seem a bit random but I am obsessed with these at the moment and have been since about November when I first saw them… enough so to declare them as my favourite which as a massive chocolate lover is a bold claim. I was never addicted to curlywurlys them selves but something about these I just can’t get enough of so if you are walking through your super markets confectionary isle and see them I recommend trying them.

  <p>
    I’ve never had great skin and as a result of that I’ve spent a lot of money over the years on trying new skincare products to try and help. I’m not saying this is the only thing that works as I also do love The Body Shop Aloe Vera range, but I got given these at Christmas and my skin seems to love them! I’m not saying that my skin has cleared up as it’s going to take a long while to get there but it’s probably the best it’s looked in a while and my skin feels so soft and clean after using it that they’ve fast become my favourites. It is expensive yes but I’ve learnt sometimes when it comes to skincare you do need to pay a bit more to get the best results, although as I said the body shop has some great alternatives which I still use.

  <h2 id="2">Face Halo - 09/02/2018</h2>

  <p>
    Following on from skincare, swapping out makeup remover for the Face Halo is another thing that has massively benefited my skin. This works by removing your makeup with just the addition of water! I’m not sure the exact science behind it as it feels like just a cloth to me but it actually works and I love it. It’s so easy to clean and lasts a long time so is much more environmentally friendly then makeup wipes or cotton pads. It takes off all my makeup, including that which us waterproof, but more importantly it means I’m no longer putting excess oils and chemical products on my skin which aggravate my acne and oily skin, resulting in this Face Halo being a factor in my improved skin; so how can I not include it as a favourite.

  <h2 id="1">Too Faced: Born This Way Foundation - 02/02/2018</h2>

  <img class="postImageRight" src="static/TooFaced.png" alt="Too Faced foundation" />

  <p>
    So I may or may not be slightly obsessed with makeup, and as a result of this, I have quiet the collection and so I thought I’d share with you all my favourite high end foundation of the moment; Born This Way by Too Faced. I don’t think this is a very popular brand in the UK as the only places to get it are Debenhams and Selfridges but I really recommend it. The colour match to my skin is right instead of being too orange and the coverage is just what I like; it’s medium coverage but it buildable to a full coverage when needed. On top of that it looks so natural on the skin which is the look I personally prefer to go for as I’m not one for the foundation mask.
