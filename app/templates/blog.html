    A big part of moving away for university is living making a new group of friends, and as much fun as they may be and despite the great memories that you may make, your friends from home will probably, in the words of BeyoncÃ©, be irreplaceable; at least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve found. I consider myself very lucky to have a strong friendship group in which the six of us are very close and have kept in contact with each other despite us all being separated! And Iâ€™m even more lucky as one of them is actually in Leeds for Uni too although at Uni of Leeds instead of Leeds Beckettâ€¦ controversial I know ðŸ˜‰.

    Following the rules of the majority wins, the other 4 all came up to Leeds last weekend as there are two of us here and it has made me realise how much I appreciate them. You may never realise how much they mean until you see them and they just make you feel so happy; an emotion you may think you are feeling daily but never as much as in the company of your home friends. We had such an amazing time, from shopping and feeling judged in the posh shops of Victoria Gate and Victoria Quarter, having an amazing meal in Giraffe, cocktails in Manhatta, to a night out clubbing with my best friends; it was one of my favourite memories in Leeds. Oh! and letâ€™s not forget the obligatory morning after breakfast at whether spoons before they had to get the train home. I never even realised how much I missed spending time with them and needed them until they came up and Iâ€™m so grateful they did even though it was touch and go for a while there due to the crazy weather we had in England, courtesy of storm Emma, but thatâ€™s a tale for another time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you all had as good a weekend as I did and just remember to always appreciate your friends even if you see them less that you used to.

    Having woken up this morning to the freezing cold and the snow against my window, I've longed for nothing more than to return to the summer of endless hot weather. I mean let's face it, if you live in England this has been one of the best summers in a long time, I mean I may only be 20 but I honestly can't remember ever having weather as good as it was. Having said that, the bar has now been set pretty high, so mother nature best be listening as I'm sure I'm not the only one expecting a repeat next year.
    Anyways as I sit here in bed with my laptop and bundled up in my duvet I find myself reminiscing about all the memories of summer 2017 and wishing I could go back just for a day. It's not even like I went on an exotic holiday that would make everyone jealous because letâ€™s be honest, I don't have that type of money; I merely spent my summer holidays visiting different parts of the UK with my family. I mean come on the furthest I travelled was Alnmouth, that's not to discredit the holiday as being so close to Alnwick made some of my Harry Potter dreams come to life!

    As you can see I spent much of my time at the beach, or at least that's what I took photos of ;).
  </p>

  <p>
    I mean I did take many photos with my family in them but I'm not quiet sure that they'll appreciate me posting them online... as can be expected.

  <h2 id="3">Serious Adulting...</h2>

  <p class="date">
    25/02/2018
  </p>

  <p>
    So, this week has been filled with some major stress factors if Iâ€™m being honest, and the only way I can describe it, is that Iâ€™ve been doing some serious adulting.
    Now, Iâ€™m sure most people have applied for a part time job at some point in their life, whether you got the job or not, and Iâ€™m sure that it seemed so stressful at that time, but Iâ€™m here to tell you that the days of checking over your CV and writing a generic 3 sentence cover letter are missed.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of my course Iâ€™m having to complete a yearâ€™s placement and the application process for that is something Iâ€™m still not sure Iâ€™m prepared for! I mean it feels like Iâ€™m doing an extra module for the amount of time and effort I have to put into each application. Iâ€™m sure there are people out there who just blag there way through a cover letter and application form, and I mean as much as I can just pretend I know what Iâ€™m talking about for most things in life, itâ€™s not something Iâ€™d ever risk for something so important. This means that for each application I submit or company I want to work for, I spend a good 2 hours at the very least researching them to find information I can put into a cover letters, use in interviews and just generally have a greater understanding about a potential future employer. Now I understand that this is something that needs doing and the work isnâ€™t what bothers me, itâ€™s more getting attached to a company and getting excited to work for them only to get rejected and feel my resolve break that tiny bit more.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Iâ€™m sure you can guess, Iâ€™ve been applying for placements for some time and clearly been unsuccessful, so what is it about this week that has made me upload this? The answer being applying to my dream placement at Disney Studios. For as long as I remember Iâ€™ve wanted to work in the entertainment industry and this placement would be a dream come true; hence the stress that has accompanied this coming week. With it being one of the most sought-after PR Placements in the UK Iâ€™m not expecting to get itâ€¦ however for full discretion I really want it!
  </p>

  <p>
    This whole process of applying for a proper job is probably the first thing thatâ€™s made me feel like an adult and to be honest the only thought going through my head is â€˜sh**â€™s getting realâ€™!

  <h2 id="2">Sports Matches and Leeds Varsity</h2>

  <p>
    So I went to my first rugby match the other day and after watching a whole game Iâ€™m still none the wiser to the rules of the game. I went into the match knowing only that the ball cannot be passed forward, and I left the game with only that bit of knowledgeâ€¦.
    I mean I know that a great level of skill must be required to play the game as is the case with all sports, but from an outside and non-rugby related perspective it just looks like a player runs for 10 seconds and then everyone jumps on them and then play continues and they do it all over again. I am aware that this is part of the game but frankly it just seems bizarre. Not to mention the scoring system; one minute you think one team is in the lead and next thing they have another 5 points from one try, I mean I canâ€™t be the only person who doesnâ€™t see how that works, but then again what do I know!

  <p>
    That isnâ€™t to say that I didnâ€™t enjoy myself, but then again, this match was more to do with the rivalry between The University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett University and what insults you can chant across to the other team, rather than the sport itself. I even found myself getting into the game as time went on regardless of the fact that I didnâ€™t really understand what was going on, so I guess it doesn't really matter.

    Where to begin...
  </p>

  <p>
    ...Well for one my name is Raveenaâ€¦ as you may or may not have guessed by the user name.
  </p>

  <img class="aboutImage" src="static/AboutRav.jpg" alt="Me in Alnwick Gardens" />

  <p>
    I've been at university for over a year now and have decided that now would be the perfect time to start a new blog; especially as my uni friends still aren't accustomed to my incessant ramblings and ranting, so would probably appreciate me taking to my blog instead of their ears. I mean I'm not that bad but have been told I can take some getting used to and I don't want to scare them off to early ;).... aaand I'm already going off topic!
    I'm not entirely sure what this blog will actually be about, but as you may have guessed from the post title, the posts will all probably be extremely random, a reflection of myself if I'm being entirely honest. I'll try to post at least once a week but it may be more as I tend to write as the inspiration hits so you could find yourselves being spammed daily, but then complete radio silence for a while, but I guess that'll be something I'll try to work on :)
    I hope you guys enjoy reading it.... if anyone actually is, and I'll catch up with you soon. :)
